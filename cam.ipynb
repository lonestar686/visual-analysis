    "Have you ever wondered just how a neural network model like ResNet decides on its decision to determine that an image is a cat or a flower in the field? Class Activation Mappings (CAM) can provide some insight into this process by overlaying a heatmap over the original image to show us where our model thought most strongly that this cat was indeed a cat.\n",
